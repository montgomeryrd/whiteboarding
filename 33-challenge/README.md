CF 33: Whiteboard Challenge
Requirements
Write a function while takes two arguments, a base number and an exponential, and returns the sum of the return value's digits.

For example: fn(2, 15) => 32768 => 26

Write at least four tests for this function

your tests should cover basic (expected) functionality
your tests should consider edge cases for your function (ex: will your function still operate on an array of floating point integers?)
Submission Instructions
With your assigned partner, pseudocode your solution on the whiteboard. Take a picture of your proposed solution for your repo.
Make a new branch and folder in your whiteboard challenge repository on GitHub. The name of the folder should be the same as the name of the challenge.
This folder should contain:
A file named solution.js which contains the JavaScript solution
A picture of your pseudocoded solution from the whiteboarding exercise
A README.md which includes the problem domain
Complete the whiteboard challenge in your text editor, and verify that it's functional.
Make a pull request from your working branch to your master branch.
Submit a link to your PR, or a link to your repo/submission, in Canvas.
