CF 36: Whiteboard Challenge
Requirements
Write a function which takes two binary search trees as arguments, and compares them for structural likeness.
If they are structurally identical, return true
Else return false
Write at least four tests for this function

your tests should cover basic (expected) functionality
your tests should consider edge cases for your function (ex: will your function still operate on an array of floating point integers?)
Submission Instructions
With your assigned partner, pseudo-code your solution on the whiteboard. Take a picture of your proposed solution for your repo.
Make a new branch and folder in your whiteboard challenge repository on GitHub. The name of the folder should be the same as the name of the challenge.
This folder should contain:
A file named solution.js which contains the JavaScript solution
A picture of your pseudo-coded solution from the whiteboarding exercise
A README.md which includes the problem domain
Complete the whiteboard challenge in your text editor, and verify that it's functional.
Make a pull request from your working branch to your master branch.
Submit a link to your PR, or a link to your repo/submission, in Canvas.
