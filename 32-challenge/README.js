CF 32: Whiteboard Challenge

The fibonacci series is an ordering of numbers where each number is the sum of the preceeding two.

Write two functions to print out the nth entry in the fibonacci series, recursively and iteratively
ex: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34] forms the first ten entries of the fibonacci series

ex: fib(4) === 3

Write at least four tests for each function (they will generally cover the same IO for each function)

your tests should cover basic (expected) functionality
your tests should consider edge cases for your function (ex: will your function still operate on an array of floating point integers?)
In your README.md explain why you would NOT use recursion to solve fibonacci, even though you CAN.

Submission Instructions
With your assigned partner, pseudocode your solution on the whiteboard. Take a picture of your proposed solution for your repo.
Make a new branch and folder in your whiteboard challenge repository on GitHub. The name of the folder should be the same as the name of the challenge.
This folder should contain:
A file named solution.js which contains the JavaScript solution
A picture of your pseudocoded solution from the whiteboarding exercise
A README.md which includes the problem domain
Complete the whiteboard challenge in your text editor, and verify that it's functional.
Make a pull request from your working branch to your master branch.
Submit a link to your PR, or a link to your repo/submission, in Canvas.
